        content: |
            The dash/DAQ will be responsible for collecting data from the ECU and other sensors around the car, logging that data, and displaying real-time information to the driver.
            
            We have chosen to buy an off-the-shelf dash/DAQ this year. (Custom dash/DAQ will be pursued in the future.) The dash/DAQ we chose is the AiM MXS 1.3. This make and model was chosen for its dual CAN buses, large amount of memory, and extensive documentation.
