My book worm, early rising
Toasted peanut butter sandwich
To solve her morning famish
Snoring like an apache helicopter

Hugs from frail bones
Unceasingly sweet
A wrinkle for each smile

Five hour trips to farms, fields, family
Far away from Fazolis and Cheesecake Factorys
Irrevocable memories

Scrabble, puzzles, solitaire on ancient computers
Every Monopoly under the sun
Board game pieces which moved me more than I moved them

Books read over the phone
Scary stories told in the dark
A big hairy toe for supper
Shaped me to be me
