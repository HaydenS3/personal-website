Have Lim√≥n or Vuong ridden rooftops?
Taken in the city from a new perspective
Stared into glass walled apartments
Wore their heart on their sleeve
Drugged themselves with shots of Jameson
Sliced open their abdomen so their ugly guts
Spilled on the trash ridden roads below
Sat there and counted the taxis as they went by
Promised themselves a bed of roses at the bottom of 13 stories
Fluffed a pillow and gazed into the freckleless sky
