Still

I’m
    wond’ring how to read my mind
        stumbling now i try to find
Lost
        fragments of a line
        reason or a rhyme 
Still
        what whispers could hide
        soft behind closed eyes
Filled
        with all the lies
        i may have sold
Heavy
        with all the cries
        my heart must hold
Still
        one thing i never have been told
        how do i listen to my soul
