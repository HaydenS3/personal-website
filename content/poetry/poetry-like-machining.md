<pre>
The whir of lathes which hold words in their chuck
Which chisel away slowly in low hum
Each atom will break stock becomes unstuck
Consistency creates fine work when done

It seems impossible the way it is formed
By a strong little tool so greatly adorned
It cuts through metal leaves shavings on the floor
Searching to find whatâ€™s remaining at the core

With accuracy enormous
Unrecognizable to the eye
Observant calipers will notice
And no impurities will go by

Each action is important, and will take so much time
But each second is worth it, to create craft sublime
The joy it brings me should be considered a crime
In hopes to share it with you I deliver these lines
