solitude. serenity. a space so large and so empty. brainwaves escape the cranium and tango to tunes. neuron superposition. thoughts echo in chorus. crashing into the walls like whitecaps. wav files. wisdom wades through the waters. understanding sweeps between the toes of crisis. drowns existing vices. bass hits rippleless. does anyone know this? does anyone notice? where music and silence coexists. a ballad of bliss. soft serotonin. salty sweet aroma. nitrous oxide. like the few moments before losing consciousness. preserved in the presence of time.
