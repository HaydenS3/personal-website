<pre>
stunning and sweet
smart, but slightly insane, two
marbles tango in her cranium

colors fling from dresses
splatter upon her skull
like clouds in the sky

does she know her shoelaces are tied together?
no worries
her mouth will do the walking

jailed in a white room, cushioned by 
j pollocks which hang from the walls
her wild eyes stare at me like stuffed animals

I love you
