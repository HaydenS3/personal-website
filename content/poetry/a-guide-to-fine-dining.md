<pre>
Please stop sitting me at white cloth tables
Where two faced menus 
Hide green beans in haricot vert labels

My pride is not fed by fine caviar
But by wedding cakes 
And handfuls of leftover candy hearts

<i>no. let me be the owner of a Michelin star restaurant.</i> 

we’ll serve pb&js & half burnt homestyle
breakfasts for broken hearts & crayon signs will
say throw your prom dress away & take your
heels off at the door & this establishment calls
for mismatched socks & baggy sweatshirts &
when you’re ordering don’t fluster just muster
the courage to ask for the kids mac & cheese &
please 

Take a smile and a mint when you leave
