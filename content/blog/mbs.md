Missouri Boys State is an eight-day leadership program for high school juniors. Each year, about 1,000 students participate, working together to build a complete state government. Some students interview to become the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, others study to practice MBS law, and some will test their courage by running for governor.

As a volunteer city counselor for this program, I have the privilege of guiding a group of about 30 students within the city over the course of eight demanding but rewarding days.  They have faced and overcome challenges, grown as leaders, and formed bonds that will last a lifetime. By the last night of the program, I am confident that I have made a positive impact on their lives.

In 2022  my city wrote letters for me. Here are excerpts from a few:
- “This week was a week that will always be ingrained into my mind. I thank you for going out of your way and spending this time with us. I’m going to go out into the world and make big changes thanks to your selfless acts.”
- “Thank you for all you did this week. I really appreciate you making me feel part of the Richardson family. You don’t know how much you have impacted me and changed my life.”
- “You were definitely the easiest counselor to talk  to, and it felt like if I had an issue, you were the one I’d probably go to first. You were also the nicest counselor. I think it was you who really helped me come out of my shell. Thank you for your kindness.”
